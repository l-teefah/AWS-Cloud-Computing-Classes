# **AWS User, Groups and Directory Guide Instructions**

This README provides a comprehensive set of step-by-step guides designed to help perform essential tasks on an AWS environment from scratch. Each guide walks through connecting to an EC2 instance, managing users and groups, working with files and directories, monitoring processes, and automating repetitive tasks using cron jobs.

Whether you're new to AWS or looking to solidify your skills, these instructions provide practical, hands-on experience with core AWS concepts and Linux commands. You will learn how to:

- Create and manage users and groups.
- Organize and restructure directories and files.
- Back up data and log critical details.
- Monitor system processes.
- Automate tasks for efficiency.

### **Prerequisites**

## Set Up and Connect to an EC2 Instance

### Step 1: Create an EC2 Instance
1. Go to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 service and launch a new instance.
   - Choose a Linux-based AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).
   - Select an instance type (e.g., t3.micro).
   - Configure instance details and security groups to allow SSH access (port 22).
3. Generate a new key pair during setup (e.g., `key_pair.pem`).
4. Download the `.pem` file and save it securely.

### Step 2: Configure SSH Connection

#### **Windows Users**
1. Download PuTTY from its [official website](https://www.putty.org/).
2. Convert `.pem` to `.ppk` using PuTTYgen:
   - Open PuTTYgen, load the `.pem` file, and save it as `.ppk`.
3. Open PuTTY and configure the session:
   - Hostname: `<public-ip>` (Replace with the EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP address.)
   - SSH > Auth: Browse and load the `.ppk` file.
   - Connection: Set keepalives to 30 seconds.
4. Click **Open**, log in as `ec2-user` when prompted.

#### **macOS and Linux Users**
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.pem` file and edit `~/Downloads` with the path to the key pair file:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
   
3. Set appropriate permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod 400 <key_pair.pem>
   ```
   
**Replace `<key_pair.pem>` with the name of your key pair file.**
  
4. Connect to the EC2 instance:

   ```bash
   ssh -i key_pair.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
   ```
   
**Replace `<public-ip>` & `key_pair.pem` with the public IP address of the EC2 instance and name of your key pair file.**

| Zara       | Ali         | zali         | Customer Support    | P@ssword2025      | Personell |


1. Create users using `useradd` and set their passwords using `passwd`. Replace `<username>` & `<password>` with appropriate User ID and password from the table above. 

   ```bash
   sudo useradd <username>
   sudo passwd <password>
   ```

2. Validate users:

   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1
   ```

3. Create groups using `groupadd`, replace `<group_name>` with each group:

   ```bash
   sudo groupadd <group_name>
   ```

4. Add users to groups, replace `<group_name>` & `<username>` with appropriate group name and username respectively for each entry in the table e.g., `sudo usermod -a -G Managers cfernandez`:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G <group_name> <username>
   ```

5. Validate group memberships:

   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/group
   ```

6. Switch users using, replace `<username>` with any username:

   ```bash
   su <username>
   ```

7. Verify permissions and sudo access. Ensure unauthorized sudo commands are logged.

   ```bash
   mkdir MyCompany/HumanResources/TeamMembers
   mv MyCompany/HumanResources/{PerformanceReviews.csv,Onboarding.csv} MyCompany/HumanResources/TeamMembers
   ```
